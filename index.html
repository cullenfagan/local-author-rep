			<p class="intro"> <span class="location"> Bronx, New York -- </span> Over the last few years, Soundview-born artist C.G. Esperanza has authored and illustrated a series of picture books about Bronx culture, featuring characters based on local children. Through his books, Esperanza wants to help the children he's writing about, particularly Black and brown children, be proud of who they are and where they come from. Studies have shown that representation is deeply influential for Black and brown children's self esteem, and children's literature is a major avenue for them to see themselves and their peers represented positively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Black authors and Black characters are still underrepresented in children's literature and publishing, but their presence has continued to grow over the past few decades. The last few years have seen major strides in increased diveristy and representation, including a notable but short-lived bump in 2020, associated with the BLM movement.
